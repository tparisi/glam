ShaderParticleEngine
====================
A GLSL-heavy particle engine for THREE.js. Based on [Stemkoski's great particle engine](https://github.com/stemkoski/stemkoski.github.com/blob/master/Three.js/js/ParticleEngine.js).


Pull requests and issue reports welcome. Please see the notes on pull requests at the end of this document.


Version 0.7.9
=============
* Fixed an issue with THREE.js r71. See breaking changes notes directly below. Please update if you're planning to use THREE.js r71+.


Breaking Changes
================
* **Version 0.7.9** The ```transparent``` option/property of ```SPE.Group``` must be passed as a `Boolean` (`true` / `false`). It would previously accept numeric values (`0` for `false`, `1` for `true`), but this has been deprecated due to a change in the way THREE.js r71 handles the transparent property in materials.

* **Version 0.7.4** There's a change in the way the total number of particles an emitter has is calculated, and one emitter option rename:
	* ```SPE.Emitter#particlesPerSecond``` is now ```SPE.Emitter#particleCount```.
		* Rather than specifying how many particles an emitter will produce per second, you now specify the total number of particles yourself.
	* Renamed ```SPE.Emitter#emitterDuration``` to ```SPE.Emitter#duration```.

* **Version 0.7.3** has renamed and added a lot of emitter options. Opacity, color, size, and angle are now consistent. They all have *Start, *Middle, and *End varients, as well as *StartSpread, *MiddleSpread, and *EndSpread varients. As an example:
	* ```opacityStart```, ```opacityStartSpread```,
	* ```opacityMiddle```, ```opacityMiddleSpread```,
	* ```opacityEnd```, ```opacityEndSpread```.

* **Version 0.7.2** packages up the emitter objects (Group, Emitter, utils) into one namespace: ```SPE```.
	* To create a particle group from **v0.7.2+**: ```new SPE.Group( ... )```.
	* To create a particle emitter from **v0.7.2+**: ```new SPE.Emitter( ... )```.



About
=====
After experimenting with Stemkoski's particle engine, I was having trouble getting high numbers of particles to render at ~60fps. After digging into the code and doing some benchmarks, it was clear that the bottleneck was coming from applying each particle's movement parameters (```velocity += acceleration```, and ```position += velocity```). After moving these calculations to the shaders the performance was drastically increased.

Another optimisation I wanted was to be able to 'group' lots of emitters into one ```THREE.ParticleSystem```, so that if I had (for example) 20 particle emitters sharing the same texture, I could send all 20 of those emitters to the GPU at the same time via sharing the same geometry. This is where the basis for the ```ShaderParticleGroup``` comes from.

This project requires THREE.js revision 65+. Known to work on revision 70, but in-depth testing not performed as of yet. Assuming future THREE.js versions don't remove certain methods without warning of deprecation, it *should* be future-proof to a certain extent.



Usage
=====
See the ```./examples/``` folder (or [here](http://squarefeet.github.io/ShaderParticleEngine/)) for some simple demos.

Assuming you have a basic scene set up using THREE.js and have added the JS to your page, adding a particle emitter is as simple as the following code:

```javascript
// Create a particle group to add the emitter to.
var particleGroup = new SPE.Group({
	// Give the particles in this group a texture
	texture: THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture('path/to/your/texture.file'),

	// How long should the particles live for? Measured in seconds.
	maxAge: 5
});

// Create a single emitter
var particleEmitter = new SPE.Emitter({
	type: 'cube',
	position: new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0),
	acceleration: new THREE.Vector3(0, 10, 0),
	velocity: new THREE.Vector3(0, 15, 0),
	particlesPerSecond: 100,
	sizeStart: 10,
	sizeEnd: 0,
	opacityStart: 1,
	opacityEnd: 0,
	colorStart: new THREE.Color('blue'),
	colorEnd: new THREE.Color('white')
});

// Add the emitter to the group.
particleGroup.addEmitter( particleEmitter );

// Add the particle group to the scene so it can be drawn.
scene.add( particleGroup.mesh ); // Where `scene` is an instance of `THREE.Scene`.

// ...

// In your frame render function:
// 	Where dt is the time delta
// 	(the time it took to render the last frame.)
particleGroup.tick( dt );

```

####"Public" Methods for ```SPE.Group```:####

**- ```.addEmitter( emitter )```**
Adds an instance of ```SPE.Emitter``` to the particle group.

**- ```.tick( dt )```**
Call this function once per frame. If no ```dt``` argument is given, the ```SPE.Group``` instance will use its ```.fixedTimeStep``` value as ```dt```.

**- ```.addPool( numEmitters, emitterSettings, createNewEmitterIfPoolRunsOut )```**
Automatically create a pool of emitters for easy triggering in the future.

**- ```.triggerPoolEmitter( numEmittersToActivate, positionVector )```**
Turn on a given number of emitters that live in a pool created using the method above. You can also pass a ```THREE.Vector3``` instance to dictate where this emitter will sit.


Changelog
=========

**Version 0.7.8**
* Hot-fix for when no particles are due to be emitted during a given frame, a particle's age might be set to NaN. Please update if you're using 0.7.7!

**Version 0.7.7**
* Implemented a fix for emitters not smoothly emitting when frame rates aren't completely stable. Hopefully if you happen to have an issue with emitters not looking as 'smooth' as they should, and some particles are clumping together, then try updating to this version and it should make the situation a little bit better.

**Version 0.7.6**
* Renamed THREE.ParticleSystem to THREE.PointCloud
* Fully tested on THREE r69.
* Ensured references to `SPE.Emitter#particleCount` are correct in all example files.


**Version 0.7.5**
* `SPE.Emitter#alive`: Values between 0 and 1 now control the percentage of particles that are alive at a given moment. If you have an emitter with a `particleCount` of 1000 and you set alive to be 0.1, only 100 particles will be emitted (`1000 * 0.1 === 100`).


**Version 0.7.4**
* The latest release has jumped from ```0.5.1``` to ```0.7.4```. There are no release versions in between - the party was all on the dev branch. A full log of the changes between these versions is available in the changelog towards the end of this document. There have been a lot of changes since ```0.5.1```, so if you're updating, please check the [Breaking Changes](https://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine#breaking-changes) and [Changelog](https://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine#changelog) to play catchup.

* In between ```0.5.1``` and ```0.7.4```, there have been some contributions from the community to the library:
	* [@DelvarWorld](https://github.com/delvarworld/)) has kindly brought this library into a much fitter state than it was before, and feature contributions from [@stemkoski](https://github.com/stemkoski/)) have been combined into the ```0.7.4``` release.

* Deprecated ```SPE.Emitter#particlesPerSecond``` in favour of ```SPE.Emitter#particleCount```.
* Renamed ```SPE.Emitter#emitterDuration``` to ```SPE.Emitter#duration```.



**Version 0.7.3**
* Added the following properties:
	* ```sizeEndSpread```, ```opacityEndSpread```, ```colorEndSpread```
	* ```sizeMiddleSpread```, ```opacityMiddleSpread```, ```colorMiddleSpread```
	* ```angleStart``` (replaces ```angle```), ```angleStartSpread```,
	* ```angleMiddle```, ```angleMiddleSpread```,
	* ```angleEnd```, ```angleEndSpread```

**Version 0.7.2**
* Moved ```ShaderParticleGroup```, ```ShaderParticleEmitter```, and ```shaderParticleUtils``` to a shared object. ```SPE.Group```, ```SPE.Emitter```, and ```SPE.utils``` respectively.

**Version 0.7.1**
* Changed the attribute model. Size attributes, opacity attributes, and angle attributes are all squashed into shared attributes using various vector types.
* Added ```sizeMiddle``` functionality.

**Version 0.7.0**
* new ShaderParticleUtils object (alpha) to share functions between the Group and Emitter constructors.
* ShaderParticleGroup.removeEmitter()
* ShaderParticleEmitter.angle
* ShaderParticleEmitter.angleAlignVelocity

**Version 0.6.0**
* To adjust particle sizes, please use `sizeStart` instead of the old `size` property.
* Particle angles are now supported, thanks to [Stemkoski](https://github.com/stemkoski/).


**Version 0.5.1**
* Fixed some issues with parseFloat and accidental globals. Thanks to [DelvarWorld](https://github.com/DelvarWorld) for noticing these.


**Version 0.5.0**
* The latest update sees the addition of the ```ShaderParticleGroup.addPool()``` method. This allows for much easier control of emitter pools. See [the pool example](http://squarefeet.github.io/ShaderParticleEngine/examples/pool.html) for an example.
* There are also quite a few bug fixes courtesy of [Stemkoski](https://github.com/stemkoski/).
* I've also added quite a few more comments to the source-code, so it should be easier to get your head around should you want/need to dig into the internals.



Building
========
This project uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to create the distributions, one dev build (not minimized) and one production build (minimized). If you make changes and want to build it, follow these steps:

If you don't have grunt installed, first make sure you've got [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and NPM installed, then install Grunt CLI. You might have to do this as root:

```npm install -g grunt-cli```

Now you can install the local grunt package:

```cd [projectFolder] && npm install && grunt```


The output of grunt will sit in the `build` folder.



Known Bugs
==========
* There is an issue using ```SPE.Emitter#angleAlignVelocity``` if your emitter isn't positioned at origin (0, 0, 0). This is being investigated.

See the [issues page](https://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine/issues) for any known other bugs. Please open an issue if you find anything not behaving properly.
